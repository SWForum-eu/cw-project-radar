        p:  | The SWForum Project radar provides an accurate and unique birds eye view of the European 
            | R&amp;I of EC-funded projects. The backbone of the EU 
            | Project Radar are three segments which represent the SWForum R&amp;I taxonomy as 
            | defined by the University of Oxford. These are described below.
        p:  | When populating the radar, a project's classification according to the taxonomy
            | determines the sector in which the project's radar "blip" (a small circle/triangle) will
            | be placed.

        p:  | By clicking on the radar segments, you can dive deeper into each theme and get a 
            | clearer picture of the different projects that have been funded and their relative 
            | maturity. Each blip represents a project and you can click  on them for more 
            | information. Projects are also listed on the right of the screen and information 
            | can be accessed there too by clicking on the project name.
        p:  | Use the ACM Taxonomy filter to identify projects working on a particular technology 
            | or vertical sector.

        div.title SWForum Taxonomy
        p:  | The SWForum.eu project uses University of Oxford's SWForum Taxonomy 
            | to classify projects for the radar.
            | The taxonomy includes three terms whose definitions are given below.

    section.sub-topic
        div.title Languages and Frameworks
        p:  | This can be any kind of new programming language and/or a language framework. 

    section.sub-topic
        div.title Tools and Techniques
        p:  | Tools can be components, such as databases, software development tools, 
            | such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence.
            | Techniques include elements of a software development process, 
            | such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices.

    section.sub-topic
        div.title Platforms
        p:  | Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, 
            | virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.

        div.title Filter projects by ACM taxonomy terms
        p:  | If you are looking for projects that are working on a particular technology or 
            | vertical sector then by clicking on “ACM Taxonomy” you can hone in on range of 
            | choices of exactly which topics to view.
        p:  | The filters are based on ACM's Computing Classification System
            | which has been designed to categorise EU competencies in the field. The radar 
            | quickly visualizes the different selections that you make based on this 
            | three-dimensional taxonomy which covers Computer Systems Organization, Software and its Engineering, 
            | Theory of Computation, Mathematics of Computing, Information Systems, Security and Privacy, 
            | Human-centered Computing, Computing Methodologies, Networks, and Applied Computing.
        p:  | You can also quickly visualize statistics pertaining to your selection including 
            | the number of projects and their type, total budget, average budget, total duration and average duration.

        p:  | You can view the full ACM taxonomy

            | . SWForum.eu contributed to this first edition sharing information of the 
            | SWForum.eu taxonomy mentioned above.
