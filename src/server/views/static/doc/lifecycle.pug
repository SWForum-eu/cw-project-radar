        div.title Project lifecycle
        p:  | Just as software, projects undergo a common lifecycle. For the purpose of this 
            | Project Radar, we have defined the following stages in a project lifecycle that are
            | of interest here:
        p(style="text-align: center;") Assess &#8594; Trial &#8594; Adopt &#8594; Hold
        p:  | The rings represent the position of the projects in terms of their contractual 
            | project lifecycle. It assumes that projects generally progress satisfactorily 
            | towards their goals and outcom, relying on this being ensured by the funding 
            | programmes own checks and balances. In the case of EU H2020, these are the regular 
            | project reviews, and the selection of expert reviewers for the project by the 
            | Commission.

        p:  | As this progression through the rings is not immediately clear, a red demarcation 
            | circle in the radars illustrate the border between the "Assess" and "Hold state" that,
            | while visual neighbours, are very different stages in a project lifecycle.

        p  
            em Technical criterion: 
            | The project is running, and has 
            b more than 2 years to go.
        p:  | The project is still running, and has still a considerable amount of time to 
            | further mature their results and outputs, yet needs to think about how it will 
            | play out the final stretch of project lifetime.
        p
            em Recommendation: 
            | Study the project’s high-level description and designated outputs, and compare 
            | with your own strategy and needs. If there is a match, put the project on a 
            | personal/specific short-list for further check-up later.

        div.title 3. Adopt
        p  
            em Technical criterion: 
            | The project is running and has
            b less than 12 months to go.
        p:   | The project is now seriously busy finalising its planned outputs. That might be a 
            | piece of software, an innovative algorithm, or a study whose results may impact 
            | your own work. Some of the planned work might have been dropped in order to reach 
            | the stated goal for more important outputs.
        p
            em Recommendation: 
            | Check back regularly with the project (either actively or passively) to see how the 
            | output you are interested in is progressing. Refine your shortlist based on the 
            | results of that exercise; expect your shortlist getting smaller unless there are 
            | new projects in the pipeline that stock it up again. For those you consider 
            | specifically mature, you should consider first practical trials of integrating the 
            | output into your portfolio – not to accomplish it straight away, but to anticipate 
            | the level of “integration pain” you may experience later. Click on the project’s 
            | score card and contact then directly through their mini-site.

        div.title 4. Hold
        p  
            em Technical criterion: 
            | The project finished 
            b less than 1 year ago.
        p:  | If you haven’t already decided to integrate the project’s outputs into your own 
            | business, or more neutrally, operations at large, projects in this“stage may still 
            | have value to you, but you need to understand the how the then published outputs 
            | have fared until now, and may fare in the future.
        p:  | Project results in the IT sector, and especially in the currently very dynamic 
            | cybersecurity domain age very quickly, as competition is fierce, and many outputs 
            | are superseded by technical innovation, or other projects simply having been faster 
            | or more efficient in their execution.
        p
            em Recommendation: 
            | For projects that stayed on your shortlist unto this stage, this is the time to 
            | start serious integration trials with stable versions of the output. In the case 
            | of study results, or non-IT related outputs, the expected integration pain may 
            | affect your overall business strategy and cause changes in operations and processes, 
            | rather than technical integration challenges that present themselves with IT 
            | integrations.
