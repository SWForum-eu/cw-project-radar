        div.title Project readiness
        p:  | Assessment of Market Readiness and Technology Readiness Levels (MTRL in short) is a 
            | fundamental step in the value chain that all projects need to keep track of. Based 
            | on regular MTRL self-assessments, projects can track their relative project progress 
            | with other projects in the field. This is reported in the radar providing a status 
            | update to policy makers and potential users. 
        p:  | With 9 simple questions, projects receive a standardised feedback on their progress 
            | as well as an indication of weak points to focus on. Questions focus on maturity 
            | related topics such as the projectâ€™s maturity, product design and development, the 
            | competitive landscape, the team behind the work, accompanying documentation and IP 
            | management. Go to market strategy and supply chain are also considered.
        p:  | For a full overview of the methodology behind the MTRL scoring, see our 
            a(href="https://www.cyberwatching.eu/sites/default/files/D2.3_Methodology-for-the-classification-of-projects-and-market-readiness_vFinal.pdf") report
            | , which provides a comprehensive overview of MRL and TRL ranking and how results 
            | from the self-assessment data collected is analysed for the purposes of the radar.

        div.title Visualisation
        p:  | Project readiness is visualised using an extended traffic-light pattern as follows:
        p:  img(src="/img/readiness_scale.png", style="display: block; width: 25%; margin: auto;")
        p:  | This colour coding allows project managers and policy makers to quickly visualise 
            | which cybersecurity sub-domains are more advanced both in the technological and 
            | marketing sense, and which specific projects are leading each category. 

    section.topic
        a(name="score_calc")
        div.title Calculating scores and relative performance
        p:  | Whenever a project coordinator submits new MTRL values, a weighed score is 
            | calculated as:
        p(style="text-align: center;"): | Score = MRL x TRL
        p:  | You can see the respective MRL and TRL values in the project's information 
            | card in the "Relative performance" 
            a(href="/doc/project-info#info_card") section
            | .
        p:  | But where's the score, and what's this "relative performance"?
        p:  | To put a project's MTRL score into context (i.e., with other projects), scores of 
            | all projects in the same segment and same ring are collected. From these, the
            | following key values are calculated:
            ol
                li Lowest score;
                li Median score; and
                li Highest score.
        p:  | With that, we can normalise a project score as its Relative Performance as the 
            | difference between score and median score:
        p(style="text-align: center;"): | Relative performance = MTRL score - Median score

    section.topic
        a(name="colour_scaling")
        div.title Applying the colour scale
        p:  | The colour scale is applied by dividing the difference between min and max score 
            | into five equal intervals with an associated colour gradient, and kept as a 
            | lookup table.
        p:  | To determine which colour to use for the project blip, the Project Radar simply
            | queries the gradient lookup table.
