FASTEN,825328,ICT-16-2018,IA,2019-01-01,2021-12-31,,Fine-Grained Analysis of Software Ecosystems as Networks,"The aim is to make software ecosystems more robust by making package management more intelligent. This objective relies on the Fine-Grained Call Graph (FGCG) method that serves to analyze i) security vulnerability propagation,ii) licensing compliance,and iii) dependency risk profiles and processing. To facilitate adoption,FASTEN applies the approach to popular package managers for Java,C,and Python programming languages.",https://www.fasten-project.eu/,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/825328,https://swforum.eu/project-hub/fine-grained-analysis-software-ecosystems-networks
DECODER,824231,ICT-16-2018,RIA,2019-01-01,2021-12-31,,DEveloper COmpanion for Documented and annotatEd code Reference,"It consists of a methodology and an open source Integrated Development Environment to improve the efficiency of software development and maintenance,and to assure the quality of software in medium criticality systems,such as in IoT,cloud computing and HPC. The IDE combines information from different sources through formal and semi-formal models to deliver software project intelligence that shortens the learning curve of software programmers and maintainers and increases their productivity. With this approach developers deliver high quality code that are more secure and better aligned with requirements and maintainers know immediately what has been done,how and with which tools",https://www.decoder-project.eu/,https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/824231,https://swforum.eu/project-hub/developer-companion-documented-and-annotated-code-reference
